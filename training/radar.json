We've also found very different operational characteristics between different implementations.

We prefer to focus on the architectural and organizational approaches necessary to support independent releases.

			"description": "Service mesh is an approach to operating a secure, fast and reliable microservices ecosystem. It has been an important stepping stone in making it easier to adopt microservices at scale. It offers discovery, security, tracing, monitoring and failure handling. It provides these cross-functional capabilities without the need for a shared asset such as an API gateway or baking libraries into each service. A typical implementation involves lightweight reverse-proxy processes, aka sidecars, deployed alongside each service process in a separate container. Sidecars intercept the inbound and outbound traffic of each service and provide cross-functional capabilities mentioned above. This approach has relieved the distributed service teams from building and updating the capabilities that the mesh offers as code in their services. This has lead to an even easier adoption of polyglot programming in a microservices ecosystem. Our teams have been successfully using this approach with open source projects such as Istio and we will continue to monitor other open service mesh implementations such as Linkerd closely.",

			"description": "Amazon API Gateway enables developers to expose API services to Internet clients. It offers the usual API gateway features including traffic management, monitoring, authentication and authorization. Our teams have had positive experiences using this service to front AWS Lambda as part of serverless architectures. On the other hand, we have had more challenges using it as a more general purpose gateway to front HTTP/HTTPS endpoints running on EC2—where we have been stymied by a lack of interoperability with VPCs and difficulty in establishing client cert authentication with the gateway. Due to this mixed experience, we would like to advise teams to trial using AWS API Gateway with Lambda but assess suitability when using it in a more general setting.",
